# Chal-14_Bikesharing

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to conduct a bike trip analysis to solidfy the bike-sharing business proposal for potential investors. Tableau was utilized to create data visualizations to assist investors in interpreting the data found in the bike trip analysis.

Below are some data visualizations and brief descriptions:
Total Number of Bike Trips
![this is an image](https://github.com/ncalson/Chal-14_Bikesharing/blob/main/images/Number%20of%20Trips.png)
The total number of bike trips during August 2019 was 2,344,224.

Checkout Times for Users

The graph above shows bikes are typically in use for about 5 minutes. 

Checkout Times by Gender

The graph above shows that males have the highest bike use, secondly females, and lastly an unknown demographic.

Trips by Weekday per Hour

Areas of the heat graph above that show a darker shade of orange represent busier times of the day for bike use. Weekdays are busiest during commuting hours (8-9am, and 5-7pm). Weekends show darker shades spread across the entire day, showing that there's general use over the course of the day, but not as concentrated of bike use as weekdays during commuting hours.

Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![this is an image](https://github.com/ncalson/Chal-14_Bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
This heat graph takes the hourly use and distinguishes concentrated use between different genders. Females and males both follow the same hour structure of busier hours as mentioned when describing the "Trips by Weekday per Hour" graph, but there's a signficantly darker shade in the male column of this graph, showing that males generally use bikes more often than females. The unknown demographic shows significant less bike use than males and females, but higher use in its own category on weekends, particulary Saturday.

User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![this is an image](https://github.com/ncalson/Chal-14_Bikesharing/blob/main/images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)
This graph shows the type of user (customer vs. subscriber) and gender, and shows which demographic specifically has highest bike use by weekday. Male subscribers have the highest bike use as that area of the graph is the darkest shade. Female subscribers are the second darkest shaded area of the graph. The least shaded, and therefore lowest bike use, area of the graph is the unknown subscriber section. Customer use across all genders seems fairly balanced.

August Peak Hours
![this is an image](https://github.com/ncalson/Chal-14_Bikesharing/blob/main/images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)
The peak hour of bikes in use is 5pm, while 6pm comes in second, and 8am comes in third place for peak hour use.

## Summary:
The data reflects higher usage among male bike riders, and that the most concentrated times of bike use are during weekday commuting hours (8-9am and 5-7pm).
I would suggest includig visualizations displaying popular starting locations vs. ending locations. I would also include a visuation showing the average trip duration based on rider age to get a better understanding of the user base.
